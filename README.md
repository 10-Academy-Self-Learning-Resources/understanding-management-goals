## Overview of Understanding Management goals
Management is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Since organizations can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system. This view opens the opportunity to manage oneself, a pre-requisite to attempting to manage others. Management functions include: Planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal.

A goal is a result (an outcome) one is striving to achieve. Management goals are a system of plans a company communicates to its employees to achieve. Management goals are specific and clearly define, measurable and have a system of regulating progress, are created to be achievable and have to be agreed upon. The goals set need to be realistic and have a deadline attached to them so as to measure performance. [Learn more here](https://bizfluent.com/list-6692121-types-management-goals.html)

## Key Topics
Types of Management Style
1. Traditional Management: There is a hierarchy of employees, low level management, mid-level management, and senior management. In traditional management systems, the manager sets out expectations for the employees who need to meet goals, but the manager receives the reward of meeting those goals.
2. Team Managment: In a team management arrangement the manager is a guiding hand to help the members of the team work together to solve problems but doesn’t dictate policy and the entire team receives the reward of meeting those goals.
3. Servant Management: With this approach, the manager helps supply resources the employees need to meet company goals. In servant leadership, the organization recognizes employees as experts in their field and work to help them work efficiently.
